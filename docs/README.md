MITRE ATT&CKÂ® is a globally-accessible knowledge base of adversary tactics and techniques based on real-world observations.

## What is enterpriseattack?

A lightweight Python module to interact with the [Mitre Att&ck](https://attack.mitre.org/) Enterprise dataset. Built to be used in production applications due to it's speed and minimal depedancies. This module does not cover ICS or Mobile.

# Getting Started

If network access restrictions apply to your situation, you can download the [Mitre Att&ck Enterprise Json file](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mitre/cti/master/enterprise-attack/enterprise-attack.json) and package it into a local directory. For example with Docker packaging with your application, and transferring the json file into the container. The only network connections occur when there's either no file to leverage locally, or if you wish to overwrite the existing file.

## Install via Pip:

```bash
pip install enterpriseattack
```

## Install via Github:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/xakepnz/enterpriseattack.git
cd enterpriseattack
python3 setup.py install
```

## Initialization:

These are the default values when initializing the attack class:
* `enterprise_json` - The full file-path to the local json.
* `url` - The URL that hosts the json, defaults to the official Mitre Github.
* `include_deprecated` - Include old objects that mitre have removed from later versions.
* `update` - Force a download of the url, and rewrite the enterprise_json file.

```py
import enterpriseattack

attack = enterpriseattack.Attack(
    enterprise_json=None,
    url='https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mitre/cti/master/enterprise-attack/enterprise-attack.json',
    include_deprecated=False,
    update=False
)
```
